## Features

Currently I am fetching a local JSON data that looks like this

[
  {
    "name": "Godstar",
    "username": "rumplestiltskin",
    "password": "123456",
    "id": "1"
  },
  {
    "name": "Ogbara",
    "username": "rumple",
    "password": "1234567",
    "id": "2"
  },
  {
    "name": "Gerrald",
    "username": "stiltSkin",
    "password": "12345678",
    "id": "3"
  },
  {
    "name": "General",
    "username": "rumpleskin",
    "password": "12345689",
    "id": "4"
  }
]

Username and password from this data can be used to login into the application.
